 Normally you won't need to use this singleton directly. 99% of the cases you will use the CocosNode interface,

 But there are some cases where you might need to use this singleton.
 Examples:
	- When you want to run an action where the target is different from a CocosNode. 
	- When you want to pause / resume the actions
