/**
 * Motion Streak manages a Ribbon based on it's motion in absolute space.
 * You construct it with a fadeTime, minimum segment size, texture path, texture
 * length and color. The fadeTime controls how long it takes each vertex in
 * the streak to fade out, the minimum segment size it how many pixels the
 * streak will move before adding a new ribbon segement, and the texture
 * length is the how many pixels the texture is stretched across. The texture
 * is vertically aligned along the streak segemnts. 
 *
 * Limitations:
 *   MotionStreak, by default, will use the GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA blending function.
 *   This blending function might not be the correct one for certain textures.
 *   But you can change it by using:
 *     [obj setBlendFunc: (ccBlendfunc) {new_src_blend_func, new_dst_blend_func}];
 *
 * @since v0.8.1
