/**
 A wrapper to the CDAudioManager object.
 This is recommended for basic audio requirements. If you just want to play some sound fx
 and some background music and have no interest in learning the lower level workings then
 this is the interface to use.
 
 Requirements:
 - Firmware: OS 2.2 or greater 
 - Files: SimpleAudioEngine.*, CocosDenshion.*
 - Frameworks: OpenAL, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation
 @since v0.8
