@b IMPORTANT
There are 3 different ways of using CocosDenshion. Depending on which you choose you 
will need to include different files and frameworks.

@par SimpleAudioEngine
This is recommended for basic audio requirements. If you just want to play some sound fx
and some background music and have no interest in learning the lower level workings then
this is the interface to use.

Requirements:
 - Firmware: OS 2.2 or greater 
 - Files: SimpleAudioEngine.*, CocosDenshion.*
 - Frameworks: OpenAL, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation
 
@par CDAudioManager
CDAudioManager is basically a thin wrapper around an AVAudioPlayer object used for playing
background music and a CDSoundEngine object used for playing sound effects. It manages the
audio session for you deals with audio session interruption. It is fairly low level and it
is expected you have some understanding of the underlying technologies. For example, for 
many use cases regarding background music it is expected you will work directly with the
backgroundMusic AVAudioPlayer which is exposed as a property.
 
Requirements:
  - Firmware: OS 2.2 or greater 
  - Files: CDAudioManager.*, CocosDenshion.*
  - Frameworks: OpenAL, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation

@par CDSoundEngine
CDSoundEngine is a sound engine built upon OpenAL and derived from Apple's oalTouch 
example. It can playback up to 32 sounds simultaneously with control over pitch, pan
and gain.  It can be set up to handle audio session interruption automatically.  You 
may decide to use CDSoundEngine directly instead of CDAudioManager or SimpleAudioEngine
because you require OS 2.0 compatibility.
 
Requirements:
  - Firmware: OS 2.0 or greater 
  - Files: CocosDenshion.*
  - Frameworks: OpenAL, AudioToolbox

/* Changelog
2.0 (2009.07.09) * Change all file names to file paths to support loading sounds from locations other than root.
                   (Thanks to Jason Cecil)
                 * Take out C++ dependencies to make it easy to include CocosDenshion in static libraries. 
1.6 (2009.07.02) * Added looping property to CDSourceWrapper so that looping flag can be toggled during playback
                   (Thanks to Pablo Ruiz)
                 * Added fix to ensure mp3 files are not decoded in software on 3.0 (Thanks to Bryan Accleroto) 
                 * Added mute to CDAudioManager
                 * Added handlers for resign active and become active to CDAudioManager (Thanks to Dominique Bongard)
			     * Added stopBackgroundMusic method with flag to indicate whether resources should be released
				   (Thanks to Dominique Bongard) 
				 * Added functionality to mute channel groups
1.5 (2009.06.13) * Added preLoadBackgroundMusic method to CDAudioManager to allow background music to be preloaded
                 * Fixed bug with sound engine locking up when trying to load non existent file asynchronously 
                   (Thanks to Edison's Labs for reporting)
1.4 (2009.06.10) * Implemented asynchronous initialisation of audio manager
                 * Implemented asynchronous loading of sound buffers
                 * Fixed problem with mute button being ignored if game played background music (Thanks to Sebastien Flory for reporting)
1.3 (2009.06.02) * Added non interruptible option for channel group
                 * Added loop parameter for playing background music
                 * Added isPlaying property to CDSourceWrapper
                 * Modified CDSourceWrapper to return last set values of pitch, pan and gain
                 * Added option of specifying callback selector for background music completion to CDAudioManager
                 * Workaround for issue in 2.2 & 2.2.1 simulator whereby OpenAL playback would be killed after 
                   an AVAudioPlayer (backgroundMusic) stops.
1.2 (2009.05.27) * Changes for integration with cocos2d svn repository.
				 * Renamed myOpenALSupport.h to CDOpenALSupport.h to distinguish it from the
				   version included with the Aeterius sound engine.
				 * Added unloadBuffer method.
				 * Updated myOpenALSupport.h to latest version with support for IMA4 compressed files
1.1 (2009.05.26) * Added code for handling audio session interruption. Thanks to Andy Fitter and
                   Ben Britten for the code.
1.0 (2009.05.01) * Initial release
