	Sneakyjoystick
	- A joystick for use with iPhone Game Development
	- Independent of external libraries

		This project is currently in the planning stages, I am currently
	analyzing both ExtrasJoystick as well as 3rd party Joysticks. I hope
	to take the good features from both, eliminate negatives, as well as
	include some new and exciting features, too.
